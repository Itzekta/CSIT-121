		<h1>About XML and JS</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>1. What is XML?</h2>
			<p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language just like html and it was developed by the W3C as a flexible method to create common information formats and share the format and the information on the Web and carry data. </p>
			<h2>2. How is XML used?  </h2>
			<p>It provides web publishing in which it constructs interactive pages and customers may customize as well . Additionally, you can save the information once and then render it for many viewers. It is used for transmitting data across systems, frequently between systems from different corporations, using syntax with slashes and brackets. It creates formats for data that is used to encode information for documentation, database records, transactions and many other types of data. It enables data sharing across businesses without mandating that their internal files follow a specific format. It's ised for web, online business, and mobile apps and other applications.  As a result, it is simpler for devices and applications of all kinds to utilize, store, send, and display data.</p>
			<h2>3. What does XML look like? (provide an example)  </h2>
			<p>Each piece of information has a tag that describes what it is. This enables developers to store context in a uniform, organized format alongside their data.</p>

			<h2>What is JavaScript? </h2>
			<p>JavaScript is a programming language used for creating and manage dynamic and interactive website content such as anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without necessitating a manual page reload.</p>
			<h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? </h2>
			<p>The basic structure of websites is provided by HTML, which is subsequently enhanced and altered by additional programs like CSS and JavaScript. Presentation, formatting, and layout are controlled via CSS. JavaScript is used to regulate how certain elements behave. JavaScript is added to an HTML web page using script tag, and similar to CSS, code can either be written inside the tag or in it's own seperate file.</p>
