				<h2>About Art:</h2>
				<p>This is a picture of an art piece I created in high school. Pottery is probably my favorite type of art because it allows me to relax and creat something 3D. It lets me express myself through a medium, just like any other art form. Art was my favorite class throughout my school years because it was only class where I can use maximum of my creative mind. As someone with a vivid imagination, storylines are my means of expressing myself, confronting challenges, and bringing a little adventure into the form of drawing fantastical worlds that I created.</p>
