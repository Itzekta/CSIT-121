				<h2>About Travelling:</h2>
				<p>This is a picture of me exploring Texas and visiting Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. While travelling many places, it made me realize that in this world, there is so much to admire and treasure. Moreover, I enjoy the sensation I get when I discover new ideas, histories, beliefs, and landscapes. Travelling is my passion because it is something I am not afraid to pursue and willing to do it as much as I can. I learn more about myself while also expanding my knowledge and broadening my global perspective.</p>
