				<h2>About Swimming:</h2>
				<p>Swimming is probably the only sport in which I never get bored with. I'm still learning different swimming styles like the butterfly, backstroke, and breastbone. One of the reasons I enjoy being in water is that it can be extremely relaxing, and the sensation of floating on the water makes me feel weightless, as if I am in another part of the world. Swimming also has a lot of health benefits, such as strengthening the muscles, increasing flexibility, and relieving stress.</p>
